- Questions:

1. 1410 flats over 5350 flats are without floor number. What do we do with them?

2. municipality/district/neighborhood tree:
	- 466 flats without district (and so without neighborhood neither)
	- 1158 flats without neighborhood (over the total of flats)

	Solution: in our model we will consider only flats from the Barcelona municipality, and all of them have district and neighborhood.
	Let's modify the API query to get flats only from the Barcelona municipality.

3. Categorical encoding of propertyType, district and neighborhood in this first "data cleaning step" or later?
